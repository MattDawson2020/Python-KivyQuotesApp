## üêç Python-Kivy quotes app

- Sixth example project from [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-python-mega-course/)
- Uses Kivy library to create a simple app that can later easily be converted to anAndoird or IOS device
- Design is primarily based around mobile user but is also usable for PC
- Libraries used: kivy, json, datetime, glob, pathlib, random. Also includes hoverable module for button hover behaviours


## üìì Comments

- Kivy library makes mobile based design very easy, as you can design and position widgets on the page with little code
- Small amount of code creates an already very usable and easily customizable template, without the need for extensive HTML and CSS
- Overall styling is not what I would consider final, but I have kept it as it was to demonstrate what can be done in about two hours by someone with no experience in the library
- I am not too keen on the use of a json file for the users and txt files for the quotes, preferring to use a DB. This is most likely done by the instructor to minimize the difficulty of making the app portable to other OS


## üíª Running the app

- Clone this repo to your local machine, navigate to the directory, and then use ``` python main.py  ``` to run the application
- The window will popup on your screen, letting you interact with the app
